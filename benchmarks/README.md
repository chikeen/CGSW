# CGSW benchmarks

Catch2 benchmarking features are used to benchmark different schems provided in this library
and their respective inner functions. It is used extensively during developement to identify
performance improvements quantitatively.

Table ... provides the most current estimates of the performance of different components of 
the schemes implemented by this library.

TODO:- provides a table here

## Run Benchmark

| Scheme                | 1\_gsw | 2\_cgsw (pvw) | 3\_cgsw(nearly square) |
